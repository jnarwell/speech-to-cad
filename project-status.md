# Project Status: OpenSCAD Voice Control

## Current Progress
- Created the full project structure with necessary folders and files
- Implemented voice recognition using SpeechRecognition and PyAudio
- Developed OpenSCAD interface for generating code and rendering models
- Created timeline management system with SQLite database
- Built NLP processor with dual-mode support (GPT API or pattern matching)
- Integrated components into a functional application
- Successfully tested basic voice commands

## Implemented Features
1. **Voice Recognition System**
   - Audio capture from microphone
   - Speech-to-text conversion using Google's API
   - Support for multiple speech recognition services (Google, Whisper)
   - Ambient noise adjustment for better recognition

2. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Command interpretation using GPT or pattern matching
   - Parameter extraction from natural language
   - Support for multiple command types

3. **CAD Operation Modules**
   - Sketch operations (square, rectangle, circle)
   - Extrude operations (linear, with direction)
   - Revolve operations (with angle control)
   - Mirror operations (across planes)
   - Basic fillet support (parameters only)

4. **Timeline Management System**
   - Session-based operation tracking
   - SQLite database for permanent storage
   - Timeline navigation commands
   - Operation history visualization

5. **OpenSCAD Interface**
   - Code generation using SolidPython
   - Automatic model rendering and preview
   - Model file saving
   - Shape and operation management

## Known Issues
- GPT API quota limitations can affect command processing
- Pattern matching may not recognize all command variations
- Limited sketch shapes supported (square, rectangle, circle)
- Fillet operation not fully implemented
- Voice recognition accuracy dependent on environment

## Next Steps
1. Enhance command recognition robustness
2. Implement more CAD operations (boolean operations, more shapes)
3. Complete fillet functionality
4. Add more timeline navigation features
5. Create a simple graphical interface for visualization
6. Add support for more complex parameters and operations
