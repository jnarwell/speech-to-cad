# Project Status: OpenSCAD Voice Control

## Current Progress
- Created initial project structure with necessary folders and files
- Set up basic README, .gitignore, and requirements.txt
- Initialized Git repository
- Modified requirements to be compatible with Python 3.13

## Project Components Planned
1. **Voice Recognition System**
   - Using SpeechRecognition library
   - Integration with PyAudio for microphone input

2. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Integration with AI models (Claude/GPT)
   - Command interpretation system

3. **CAD Operation Modules**
   - Sketch operations
   - Extrude operations
   - Fillet operations
   - Revolve operations
   - Mirror operations

4. **Timeline Management System**
   - Global timeline for all operations
   - Feature-specific timelines
   - Operation history tracking
   - Command-based timeline navigation
   
5. **OpenSCAD Interface**
   - Integration with SolidPython
   - Real-time model generation
   - Model state management

## Next Steps
1. Implement voice recognition module
2. Develop OpenSCAD interface
3. Create basic timeline structure
4. Build NLP processor for CAD commands
5. Integrate systems together
