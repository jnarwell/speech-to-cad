  - Environment setup and configuration
  - Error handling and reporting
  - Command execution pipeline

## Technical Implementation Details

### Command Processing
The system processes voice commands through the following pipeline:
1. Speech capture via microphone
2. Speech-to-text conversion
3. NLP processing (GPT or pattern matching)
4. Command type identification
5. Parameter extraction
6. Operation execution
7. Timeline storage
8. Model visualization

### Data Persistence
Operations are stored in a SQLite database with the following structure:
- **Operations table**: Stores individual operations with parameters
- **Sessions table**: Groups operations into modeling sessions

### Pattern Matching
Implemented regex patterns for common commands:
- Sketch operations: `sketch a square`, `draw a circle`, etc.
- Extrusion operations: `extrude by 20mm`, `pull up 10mm`, etc.
- Revolve operations: `revolve around z axis`, etc.
- Mirror operations: `mirror across xy plane`, etc.
- Timeline operations: `go back 2 steps`, etc.

### Environment Configuration
The application uses a `.env` file for configuration:
- API keys for speech recognition and NLP services
- OpenSCAD executable path
- Processing mode selection

## Future Technical Considerations

### Improving Voice Recognition
- Investigate custom wake words for more natural interaction
- Consider local speech recognition options for offline use
- Implement contextual recognition for better accuracy

### Enhancing NLP Capabilities
- Train a custom model specifically for CAD terminology
- Implement a more robust fallback system when GPT is unavailable
- Add support for compound commands (multiple operations in one statement)

### Expanding CAD Functionality
- Support for more complex shapes and operations
- Implementation of boolean operations
- Add material and visualization properties
- Support for dimensions and constraints

### User Interface Evolution
- Develop a web-based interface for visual feedback
- Add real-time model updates as commands are processed
- Implement visual timeline for easier navigation
- Add gesture control for hybrid voice-gesture interaction
